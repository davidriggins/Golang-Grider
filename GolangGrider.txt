All our code must belong to a package.
The first statement in Go file must be "package ..."
Standard name for the main application is "main"

// Compiles and runs the code
go run <file name>  (e.g. go run main.go)



- Simple Go file (main.go):

	package main

	import "fmt"

	func main() {
		fmt.Println("Hi there!")
	}

- How to run go.
	- With gitbash, Navigate into the folder with main.go
	- To run:
		go run main.go
		
- Some commands awailable with the Go CLI
	- go build: compiles a bunch of go source code files
		- If you were to type "go build main.go" it would build a binary 
		  called main that is an executable.  Typing ./main will run the program.
	- go run: compiles and executes one or two files
	- go fmt: formats all the code in each file in the current directory
	- go install: compiles and "installs" a package
	- go get: downloads the raw source code of someone else's package
	- go test: runs any tests associated with the current project
	
- If you were to type "go build main.go" it would build a binary called
  main that is an executable.  Typing ./main will run the program.
 
- What does "package" mean?
	- Package == Project == Workspace
	- A collection of common source code files
	- The first line of the file declares the line it belongs to.
	- main is used to create an executable type package

- What does import mean?
	- Gives a packages access to the code in the imported package.
	- Reference packages at golang.org/pkg/

- Functions
	- <function keyword> <name of function> <argument-list>:  func main(){}
	
- How is the file organized?
	- Package Declaration:  			package main
	- Import other needed packages: 	import "fmt"
	- Declare functions:				func main(){}
	
- Variable Declarations
	- var <variable name> <variable type> = <value>
		- var card string = "Ace of Spades"
	- Don't need to write variable name in this case, you could do:
		- card := "Ace of Spades"
	- Only you the ":=" syntax in variable definition. Not reassignment.
		- card = "Five of Diamonds"
		
- Basic Variable types:
	- bool
	- string
	- int
	- float64

- Functions and Return Types
	- func <function name>() <return type> {}
		- func newCard() string { return "Five" }
